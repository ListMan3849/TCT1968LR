The Nation is in a state of Growing Pains, with civil rights to America’s Black population, domestic programs hoping to jumpstart the middle class, and the war in Vietnam under more scrutiny than ever. Amidst all this, President Johnson has turned down a second full term, leaving a wide open race for three established figures.</p><p>Richard Nixon, narrowly defeated eight years ago for the Presidency, and less narrowly defeated six years ago for a Senate seat, rebrands himself as the “New Nixon,” and looks to capitalize on discontent over the Democratic Administration. Vice President Humphrey needs to urgently reverse the image of the Democratic leadership, and press for peace and justice. George Wallace of Alabama has entered this race as a defender of Southern Segregation, and looks to push his resistance on the National stage.</p></div>","image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/kObqbRh.png","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://i.imgur.com/hw7ifIU.jpeg","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":4,"year":1968,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1968: Lost Redux"}];e.credits = "u/HancockForTheUnion6";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":23,"fields":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Nixon","election":4,"party":"Republican Party","state":"California","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'>“Eight years ago, I had the highest honor of accepting your nomination for President of the United States.
